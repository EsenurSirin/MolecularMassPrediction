# MolecularMassPrediction

This project involves the development of a model that predicts the molecular masses of chemical molecules based on their atomic components. By calculating the components of molecules in the dataset and using a machine learning model to predict the molecular weights of these components, it enables the prediction of molecular weights. The results are analyzed using mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

This project name clearly expresses the primary objective and scope of the project while also reflecting an approach that encompasses machine learning, data science, and chemistry fields.
